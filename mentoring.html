					<h1>A3D3 Mentoring Program</h1>
					<p>The Equity &amp; Career&nbsp;Committee is launching a mentoring program for&nbsp;A3D3 members. It
						pairs interested students/postdocs with postdocs/faculty members within the institute. The
						program is designed to encourage and support younger scientists through a mentoring relationship
						that begins in&nbsp;October and continues through July. Each mentoring relationship is developed
						through one-on-one meetings that each pair plans.</p>
					<h2>Program Basics:&nbsp;<a href="https://forms.gle/kdMuRBCr59MrsXrA6">Sign up here for
							2022-2033!</a></h2>
					<p><strong><strong>Start</strong></strong>:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Those who would like to participate as a mentee or as a mentor&nbsp;must&nbsp;submit an
							online form located&nbsp;<a href="https://forms.gle/kdMuRBCr59MrsXrA6">HERE</a>.</li>
						<li>For 2022-2023, signups will be done in September&nbsp;and then an email will be sent to each
							participant providing the name and contact info of their mentoring partner.</li>
					</ul>
					<p><strong><strong>Frequency</strong></strong>: One-on-one meetings are typically once or twice a
						month.</p>
					<p><strong><strong>Meetings</strong></strong>: Pairs decide when and where/how to meet and the
						format of their meetings. Some pairs may be able to meet in person for coffee or lunch, others
						may meet over video chats.</p>
					<p><strong><strong>Resources</strong></strong>: This page provides participants with ideas and
						resources. The E&amp;C&nbsp;Committee is always available by email.</p>
					<p><strong><strong>End</strong></strong>: The program concludes in July. The mentorship ends at this
						point unless both the mentor and mentee choose to continue.</p>
					<h2>Mentoring Basics</h2>
					<p>Just as each pair is unique, so each relationship is unique and will look different than the next
						one. However, all mentorships have these basic components:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Fun: Create a positive, relaxed, friendly atmosphere.</li>
						<li>Conversation: Talk naturally about life activities: your thoughts, feelings, challenges,
							joys, stresses, beliefs, and decisions. Listen well and ask questions.</li>
						<li>Trust: Be honest and authentic. Keep your word. Protect personal information.</li>
						<li>Graciousness: Avoid judgmental remarks. Find ways to affirm. Show care.</li>
						<li>Insight: Contribute relevant, practical input at appropriate times.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Here are some other ideas and guidelines about mentorships:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>A mentorship is an intentional friendship.</li>
						<li>It is built slowly over time.</li>
						<li>It requires leadership and involvement from both participants.</li>
						<li>It requires confidentiality.</li>
						<li>It requires both humility and boldness.</li>
						<li>It is forward-paying; mentees often become mentors.</li>
						<li>It is not counseling or lecturing.</li>
						<li>It is not a rescue mission, fix-it service, or create-a-clone program.</li>
						<li>It is not a lifelong commitment.</li>
					</ul>
					<h2>What is mentoring?</h2>
					<p>Mentoring, like many other things in life, is difficult to define. The Uncommon Individual
						Foundation defines mentoring as "a brain to pick, an ear to listen, and a push in the right
						direction." Simply put, mentoring is doing whatever is necessary to help another person get
						where they want or need to go. Mentoring is a unique partnership that fosters growth. The
						outcome might be a problem solved, a goal achieved, a skill learned, a character trait
						developed, or an attitude caught. A good mentor empowers another by sharing ideas, wisdom,
						knowledge, skills, perspective, and resources. They might be described as a coach, counselor,
						role model, supporter, advisor, friend, or encourager.</p>
					<h2>How do I get started?</h2>
					<p>Mentoring is an intentional relationship, not a casual friendship. The first step in mentoring is
						to get to know your partner and allow them to get to know you. This requires listening, asking,
						understanding, and being transparent in sharing about yourself. The most important place to
						start is to share your goals and ideas for your mentoring time together. Here are some other
						questions you might ask:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>What are your class/research/teaching responsibilities?</li>
						<li>What part of your job are you most passionate about?</li>
						<li>What is your educational background?</li>
						<li>What activities do you enjoy outside of work?</li>
						<li>Who are the important people in your life?</li>
					</ul>
					<h2>How do we go deeper?</h2>
					<p>Below are some meaty questions that can prompt meaningful conversations.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Do you have any particular personal goals?</li>
						<li>What is most satisfying about your work life? Your home life?</li>
						<li>What is most stressful about your work life? Your home life?</li>
						<li>What are your strengths? Your weaknesses?</li>
						<li>Who do you admire? What character traits do you see in this person?</li>
						<li>What character trait do you want to develop?</li>
						<li>Who is the most positive influence in your life? The most negative?</li>
						<li>How do you create a margin of time in your busy schedule?</li>
						<li>How do you create a balanced response to all of the demands and expectations placed on you?
						</li>
						<li>How do you balance all of the opportunities and choices available to you?</li>
						<li>What is one habit you are glad you have?</li>
						<li>What is one habit you want to develop?</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Once you have developed a friendship and a level of mutual trust with your mentoring partner, you
						will begin to feel comfortable seeking out ideas, wisdom, and resources that could be applicable
						and helpful to your own circumstances.</p>
					<h2>What pitfalls should I avoid as a mentor?</h2>
					<p>A humble yet bold attitude is important when mentoring. In striving for this balance, it is easy
						to slip into the pitfalls described below. The best way to avoid them is to be aware of them.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Don't assume a problem-solver mentality. Your goal is not to tell your mentee how to fix
							everything. They need to know that their thoughts and emotions are valid. Your
							acknowledgment and affirmation will go a long way!</li>
						<li>Don't take an assembly-line approach. Your goal is not to shape your mentee into a
							predetermined product.</li>
						<li>Don't be a sage. Your goal is not to dispense wisdom on demand. Be a guide on the side.</li>
						<li>Don't plan to be the only one talking! Let your mentee participate in directing your
							conversations. Talk &lt; 50% of the time.</li>
						<li>Don't hijack the relationship by lecturing.</li>
						<li>Don't develop a messiah complex. Your goal is not to rescue or deliver your mentee from the
							struggles and pains of life.</li>
					</ul>
